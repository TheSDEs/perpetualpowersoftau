# Perpetual Powers of Tau Data Sharing

The Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony relies on a collection of large data files. Our primary storage platform is AWS S3, with a combination of standard and glacier-class storage. 

To provide an alternative storage solution, the files are shared by a network of volunteers. Data is shared using torrents. 

Participants can tailor their involvement according to the storage capacity available to them. The most essential files would include the latest contribution's response file and the complete witness history, a total of just over 50Gb. The complete archive has over 8Tb of data. In addition, we have optional folders to store the files that have been prepared for phase 2 use.
