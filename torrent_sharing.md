# Perpetual Powers of Tau Data Sharing

The Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony relies on a collection of large data files. Our primary storage platform is AWS S3, with a combination of standard and glacier-class storage. 

To provide an alternative storage solution, the files are shared by a network of volunteers. Data is shared using torrents. 

Participants can tailor their involvement according to the storage capacity available to them. The most essential files would include the latest contribution's response file and the complete witness history, a total of just over 200Gb. The complete archive has over 9Tb of data. In addition, we will soon have optional folders to store the files that have been prepared for phase 2 use. 

New files will be added to the list from time to time as new contributions are made, or data is prepared for phase 2. Participants should allow for some expansion, or at least an occasional change of priority, since the highest priority will be the most recent files.

## How to Participate

Participants will most commonly use a personal computer located at their home or office. The internet connection might be heavily used for both uploads and downloads, so an unlimited service works best. Torrent software usually allows rate limiting or customised timing. The most valuable seeders will be always on and connected, have a high bandwidth upload connection, and have plenty of storage capacity. None of those things are essential, and a useful contribution can be made even with limited uptime or  resources.

Torrent client software can be easily found online to suit individual preferences in OS, UI vs CLI, etc. In addition to setting up the torrent client, expect to do some port configuration to allow P2P connections to your device. 

Choose some files and folders to share. Download the torrent file from the link below, and add it to your client. 

In some cases, the file or folder will be available in our S3 bucket for immediate download. For such cases, you can download the data to the location your client's _downloads_ folder, and start seeding. Otherwise, once you've added the torrent, the client will download the data, gradually, from seeders. 

Most of the archival files are kept in glacier-class storage for retrieval only by request. In these cases, we will make the files available for a limited time to allow seeding to start. 

Participants may join the *Perpetual Powers of Tau Data Sharing* Telegram group. The group will be used for notifications of new data, and general coordination and support. 

## Latest Files

For the PPoT ceremony, the most essential pieces of data are the latest response file and the witness history. With this we have all the powers-of-tau points and a verifiable cryptographic proof of their derivation back to the start. For participants with limited storage available, these are the torrents to prioritise.
