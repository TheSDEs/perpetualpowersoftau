## Accepting a Contribution

The contributor will download the latest challenge file and run the contribution as per the instructions in the repo's README document. They can do this without supervision or permission, as the challenge file is available (read-only) in its S3 bucket. 
The contributor is required to provide a response file. Having compressed points, this file (51Gb) is about half the size of the challenge file. The usual method for making this file available is to ask them to upload it via SFTP to our _ppot-sftp_ EC2 instance. To prepare for the upload, make sure the server is running. It's a very light, cheap server, but best to shut it down when it's not active. Log in and check that it has enough free disk space. Delete old response or challenge files to free up space if required.
Forward these instructions to the contributor:
```
sftp ppot@18.198.151.59
The password is ****
Once connected, at the 
sftp>
 prompt:
cd uploads
put <your response file>
Then quit to exit sftp
```
Once the upload is completed, the response file will be in _/home/ppot/uploads/_. The file should be named in the format _response_nnnn_name_. Rename it at this point if required.

Copy the file to the S3 bucket. The command will be something like:
```
aws s3 cp response_nnnn_name s3://pse-trusted-setup-ppot/
```

## Verifying the Contribution

The verification step takes the *response* file produced by the contributor and the *challenge* file from which it was made, and generates a new challenge file. It first performs a check that the contribution is descended from the challenge. The hashes will be reported, so it's a good idea to capture the output and save it.
The software to perform the verify is the same as many users will use to run the contribution: https://github.com/kobigurk/phase2-bn254

### Server preparations
The verify can be run on the _ppot-sftp_ machine, but it takes a long time (> 60 hours). It's more cost-effective to spin up a more powerful machine. The verification takes about 9 hours on a *c5.4xlarge* instance. The machine can be instantiated using the *ppot verifier* AMI, which has all the necessary binaries. 

The instance needs enough storage to store 2 challenge files + 1 response file, so at least 260Gb. 

### Verify command
Once the challenge and response files are in place, the verify command can be started. Run it from the *phase2-bn254/powersoftau* folder.

Here's a sample command to run the verify:
```
$ cargo run --release --bin verify_transform_constrained challenge response new_challenge 28 2097152 >> verify_0086.log
```
This command assumes that links have been created to link *challenge* to the actual challenge file and *response* to the response file. 

Sample output:
```
Will verify and decompress a contribution to accumulator for 2^28 powers of tau

Verification succeeded!
Verification succeeded! Writing to new challenge file...
Here's the BLAKE2b hash of the decompressed participant's response as new_challenge file:
        3ee2b349 a7381bbc ceefc4dd b3b2360f
        52d61cda d9829665 f0cc078b af8622bf

        8fc1a4dc ea18fe35 82bfbd95 bd380e3f
Done! new challenge file contains the new challenge file. The other files
were left alone.
```
Check that the hash of the *challenge* file matches the one generated by the prior contribution.

The process will generate *new_challenge*. This should be renamed to the form *challenge_nnnn*, where *nnnn* is the next contribution number in sequence. Upload the file to the S3 bucket, just as for the response file.
