Attestation to response 0001
============================

**Date:** 8 - 9 September 2019

**Name:** Koh Wei Jie

**Location:** N/A

**Device(s):** A Microsoft Azure VM (Standard F4s, 4 vcpus, 8 GiB memory) running
Ubuntu 18.04 hosted on a cloud machine somewhere in Southeast Asia.

**Challenge:**

**Entropy sources:** an opaque plastic dice cup with 5 dice. I perfomed multiple
rolls and typed the numbers into the console, and also pasted in multiple
invocations of:

```
python3 -c 'import secrets, base64; print(base64.b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(4096)))'
```

from my personal laptop. Additionally, I mashed keys on my keyboard for good
measure. I admit that these measures were entirely unnecessary but I wanted to
see if the binary would accept a large amount of entropy.

**Time taken:** Around 10-18 hours

**Side channel defenses:** The first few hours of the ceremony were performed
in a makeshift Faraday cage made of aluminium foil and cling wrap. I also
removed the wifi and Bluetooth card from the laptop before running the
ceremony.

**Postprocessing:**

- I ran `verify_transform_constrained` to generate the new challenge file, and
  rebooted the laptop. I then transferred the files to an external hard drive,
  plugged that into a different laptop, and uploaded them to Azure Blob
  Storage.

- I reformatted both SSDs in my laptop, and then used `hdparm` from a live USB
  Linux distribution to securely erase them.
